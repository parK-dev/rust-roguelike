Title : Rusty Roguelike

Description: A dungeon crawler with procedurally generated levels, monsters of increasing difficulty, and turn-based movement.

Story: The hero's children have fallen ill, afflicted by a curse set upon the realm by its tyrannical ruler. The village's healer reveals that in order to cure the plague, one will need to face the monstrosities hidden in the depths of the old dungeons in order to find the Amulet of Yala - Yet Another Lost Amulet - that can be used to lift the curse. After a visit to his wife's grave, the hero promises to save the day - and sets forth into the dungeon.
